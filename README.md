# 30Day-of-R-Code

The 30 days of R code is aimed for people who are learning loads of amazing new stuff, but slowly feels their ability to program in R is fading away. 

Since the R community has a vibrant twitter community. The #30DaysOfRCode challenge, is a simple challenge,and it's so simple as eveyone should code at least for an hour every day and keep a log / tweet about it to hold yourself accountable. 

You could choose to start an online course of R and commit at least 1 hour everyday to learn and teach yourself something new. 

*The key:* try to do small and chunked measureable goals, and consistency.

## Deciding on a reasonable daily

Having a full-time job and volunteering for many other activities, might not allow you to commit to 1 - 2 hours each night or morning. Taking this in to account you might want to set aside 30 min as your daily goal for the first round of the challenge.

Why this magic number, you may ask? Half an hour can easily be freed up during your lunch break. It can be the amount of time you spend listening to a technical podcast when you're on the move. Or if you are unable to code from home, you can spend 30 min learning on an app.

"Even on ones busiest days, 30 minutes should be achievable. **Setting yourself goals that are ambitious yet actually achievable** is the key to maintaining the 30 days of R codes and not giving up on the goals you've set for yourself.

## 30DaysOfRCode is YOUR personal challenge
I've heard so many people setting themselves overly ambitious goals only to realize that life might get in the way. Some people are also incredibly strict on themselves and declare the challenge a failure if they miss a day after coding for 20 days straight.

In my opinion, bending the rules a bit to fit your lifestyle is not only important bu necessary to make it through the challenge and keep up your positve outlook. Life happens, you might get the flu, a cold,have personal circumstances prohibiting you from coding for 2 - 3 days, or simply forget a day. It's okay, as long as you get right back on track.

Sometimes people beat themselves up over not doing enough and feeling disheartened, and I felt this so many times myself. But, don't forget that the #30DaysOfRCode is your personal challenge. You decide the rules, the environment, constraints, and rewards for yourself. Don't get distracted by other people who seemingly learn faster, learn more, or build seemingly better projects. Everyone's journey is different, and each and every one of us have our own battles to fight in the background.

## Share your success
Tweeting your progress is also a big part of the challenge and possibly, one of the reason some of you might kept going at times. At the beginning, tweeting your progress will feel odd for you. But in the end, you will learn how to celebrate tiny little milestones each day.

You don't have to keep a log on github, twitter can be a personal log to review what you have learned. #The most amazing things is the constant feedback and cheering you will get from the #30DaysofRCode community. With the tendency of meeting lovely and talented people through this challenge.
